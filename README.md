# Welcome to BIP - Beer[Internet]Pong

This is a web app for tracking beer pong games online with your friends.

You can try it out [here](https://mblumberg93.github.io/bip/).

Below we explain how to play.

### Step 1 - Create A Game

First, have both you and your opponent open the BIP site on a laptop or desktop computer. When you first arrive at the site, click Create Game to generate a unique game code. After you generate the code, copy it and send it to your opponent.

### Step 2 - Join A Game

When your opponent receives the code, they paste it into the input box labeled "Enter Game Code" and click "Join Game". After doing that both of your screens should update to show the cups on the table and your side will be displayed above the table.

### Step 3 - Decide Who Starts

Below the table both you and your opponents should see buttons saying "left start" and "right start". Both of you should be able to click these buttons. When you have decided who should start, one of you click the appropriate button and the game begins. You will both see a message under the side currently playing indicating who's turn it is and the player who's turn it is will see an "end turn" button and a dropdown for reracking.

### Step 4 - Taking Turns

When you make cups in the real world, click the cups on the screen to mark them as "inactive". When cups are inactive they will turn grey. You can click them again to make them "active" in the even you clicked the wrong cup. When your turn is done click "end turn" and it will be your opponents turn.

### Step 5 - Reracking

During your turn you have the ability to rerack by clicking an option from the dropdown labelled "rerack". When you select an option the formation on your opponents side of the table will change to the selected rack. Note, reracking resets any inactive cups.

### Step 5 - End the Game

When the game is over simply click "End Game". 

### And that's all folks!
